# REGRAD Dataset
We have released part of our dataset, you can download it through [Part_REGRAD](https://stuxjtueducn-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/chaser123_stu_xjtu_edu_cn/EgT94GMlqmtHgShSnn_vxPoBMlq56mjTOkNJ-AnaXPPyrA?e=XlA8LD).

![REGRAD](REGRAD.png)  
This is a detailed decription of REGRAD Dataset.  
The Dataset can be divided into two parts, *Relation Part*  and  *Grasp Part*. Each part contains five folder, 
*train/test/seen_valid/unseen_valid/seen_test*. For every folder, the data format is the same.  
![dataset_split](dataset_split.png)  
The directory structure of REGRAD dataset is as follows. For detailed information, please read *Relation Part* and *Grasp part* .

## Grasp Part
For grasping, REGRAD provides both 2D and 3D grasping data.

The directory structure is as follows. We here take *train* folder for example.

### 3D grasp
```markdown
train
|______   scene id
|__________ *scene-id*_view_*view-id*.p (e.g. 00001_view_1.p)
```

note:

*view id*: id of the camera pose (from 1 to 9)

#### Details for 3D grasp file

1、To load the 3D grasp data (e.g. *00001\_view\_1.p*), we need to use *numpy* as follows:

```python
data = np.load('/your/filepath/00001_view_1.p', allow_pickle=True)
```

2、In order to visualize the generated grasps in scene clearly and train the network to detect the grasps, we store three kinds of data: 

*Point data* : store the point clouds.

*Raw 3D grasp data* : provide the raw grasp data before filtering. Note that it includes both high- and low-quality grasps along with the scores of grasp quality.

*Selected 3D grasp data* : include only high-quality grasp labels after filtering along with their scores of grasp quality.

- [x] **Point Data:**

```
'view_cloud': ndarray([view_point_num, 3]) Snapshot from camera view;

'view_cloud_color': ndarray([view_point_num, 3]) RGB values for each point in ‘view_cloud’;

'view_cloud_label': ndarray([view_point_num, ]) The object label(‘obj_id’) for each point in ‘view_cloud’;

'scene_cloud': ndarray([scene_point_num, 3]) Complete scene point cloud (excluding table);

'scene_cloud_table': ndarray([scene_point_num+table_point_num, 3]) Complete scene point cloud (including table);
```

- [x] **Raw 3D grasp data:**

```
'valid_frame': ndarray([sampled_point_num, len(LENGTH_SEARCH),len(THETA_SEARCH), 4, 4]) A set of generated grasp candidates on sampled point; each grasp is represented by a rotation matrix (a frame) with a shape of 4x4. Format:
[[normal[0],principal_curvature[0],minor_curvature[0],-center[0], 
[normal[1],principal_curvature[1],minor_curvature[1],-center[1], 
[normal[2],principal_curvature[2],minor_curvature[2],-center[2],  
[0,    0,           0,         1]]

'valid_index': ndarray([sampled_point_num, ]) The index of the sampled points in ‘view_cloud’;

'antipodal_score': ndarray([sampled_point_num, len(LENGTH_SEARCH),len(THETA_SEARCH)]) The force closure property of a grasp;

'vertical_score': ndarray([sampled_point_num, len(LENGTH_SEARCH),len(THETA_SEARCH)]) The verticality between the grasping direction of the gripper and the table (It is more stable to perform grasping perpendicular to the desktop);

'center_score': ndarray([sampled_point_num, len(LENGTH_SEARCH),len(THETA_SEARCH)]) The distance between the grasp point and the center point of the object (It is more stable to perform grasping near its center);

'objects_label': ndarray([sampled_point_num, len(LENGTH_SEARCH),len(THETA_SEARCH)]): The object label(‘obj_id’) of the sampled grasp points.
```

Note:

1. *sampled\_point\_num* : since using the full point cloud is inefficient, we firstly down-sample the point cloud to get a subset of points for each scene, based on which we generate the candidate grasps.

2. By sampling different gripper orientations around the approaching vector as well as the gripper depths, we generate a set of grasp candidates on each grasp point.

   *LENGTH_SEARCH* : to sample grasps, the gripper depths are taken from the set of -0.06, -0.04, -0.02, -0.00, therefore len(*LENGTH_SEARCH*)=4.

   *THETA_SEARCH* : the gripper orientations are sampled every 20 degrees from -90 to 90 degrees. Therefore  len(*THETA_SEARCH*)=9.

- [x] **Selected 3D grasp data:**

```

'select_frame': ndarray([selected_grasp_num, 4, 4]) the selected high-quality grasps, format 
[[normal[0],principal_curvature[0],minor_curvature[0],-center[0], 
[normal[1],principal_curvature[1],minor_curvature[1],-center[1], 
[normal[2],principal_curvature[2],minor_curvature[2],-center[2],  
[0,    0,           0,         1]]

'select_score': ndarray([selected_grasp_num, ]) the score of grasp quality corresponding to the selected grasps.

'select_antipodal_score': ndarray([selected_grasp_num, ]) selected antipodal_scores

'select_center_score': ndarray([selected_grasp_num, ]) selected center_scores

'select_vertical_score': ndarray([selected_grasp_num, ]) selected vertical_scores

'select_frame_label': ndarray([selected_grasps_num, ]) The object label(‘obj_id’) of the selected grasp points.
```


### 2D garsp

```markdown
train
|___scene_id
|______ view_id
|__________*view_id*.json (e.g. 1.json)
|__________*view_id*.jpg (e.g. 1.jpg)
```

#### Details for 2D grasp file

We project 3D grasp data (‘select\_frame’) to the image and filter them by ‘select\_vertical\_score’ (>0.5). But we cannot guarantee that there are graps which can be mapped into image in every scene, some files are possibly missing.

1、*view_id*.json contains a list of 2d grasps. Each grasp includes the object label('obj_id'), the rectangular grasp box, and the corresponding grasp scores.
for example:

```
[
  # grasp 1
  [
    obj_id, 
    [[center-x, center-y], [width, height], theta], 
    [select_vertical_score,select_center_score,select_antipodal_score, select_score]
  ]
  # grasp 2
  [
    obj_id, 
    [[center-x, center-y], [width, height], theta], 
    [select_vertical_score,select_center_score,select_antipodal_score, select_score]
  ]
...
]
```
2、*view_id*.jpg contains the visualized 2D grasps.
